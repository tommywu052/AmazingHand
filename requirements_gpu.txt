# GPU-accelerated dependencies for Amazing Hand tracking system
# Enhanced performance with NVIDIA CUDA support
# 
# NOTE: Python 3.12 on Windows has limited CUDA package support
# For full GPU acceleration, consider using Python 3.11

# Core dependencies (same as CPU version)
numpy>=1.21.0
pyserial>=3.5

# MediaPipe (CPU version - GPU acceleration limited on Python 3.12 Windows)
mediapipe>=0.10.0

# OpenCV (CPU version - CUDA packages not available for Python 3.12 Windows)
opencv-contrib-python>=4.8.0

# PyTorch with CUDA support (this works on Python 3.12)
# Note: Install from https://pytorch.org/ for your CUDA version
# Example: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Alternative GPU acceleration packages (if available for Python 3.12)
# These may not be available yet for Python 3.12 on Windows

# For Python 3.11 users (full GPU acceleration):
# opencv-contrib-python-cuda>=4.8.0
# mediapipe-gpu>=0.10.0

# Note: Install CUDA Toolkit and compatible drivers for your GPU
# Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools required for building from source
# Linux: GCC compiler required
